## Selected Scientific Literature
- [Are drug targets with genetic support twice as likely to be approved? Revised estimates of the impact of genetic support for drug mechanisms on the probability of drug approval](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489): Quantifies the impact of genetic evidence on a drug's probability of being approved. Must read for those building at the intersection of biopharma and tech
- [Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy
in Retinal Fundus Photographs](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45732.pdf): Google's deep learning study on diabetic retinopathy. Big money buys big datasets, but a classic work that set the gold standard in the field of DL for medicine 
- [Clinically applicable deep learning for diagnosis and referral in retinal disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0107-6): Another high profile study by Google on opthalmology imaging. Sequel to above paper but with much greater implication for clinical practice.
